# Enapter Icons Miro App

- We recommend a Chromium-based web browser for local development with HTTP. \
  Safari enforces HTTPS; therefore, it doesn't allow localhost through HTTP.
- For more information, visit our [developer documentation](https://developers.miro.com).

## How to start locally

- Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn start` to start developing. \
  Your URL should be similar to this example:
 ```
 http://localhost:3000
 ```
- Paste the URL under **App URL** in your
  [app settings](https://developers.miro.com/docs/build-your-first-hello-world-app#step-3-configure-your-app-in-miro).
- Open a board; you should see your app in the app toolbar or in the **Apps**
  panel.

## How to build the app

- Run `yarn build`. \
  This generates a static output inside [`dist/`](./dist), which you can host on a static hosting
  service.

## Folder structure

```
.
├── src
│  ├── assets
│  │  └── style.css
│  ├── app.js      // The code for the app lives here
│  └── index.js    // The code for the app entry point lives here
├── app.html       // The app itself. It's loaded on the board inside the 'appContainer'
└── index.html     // The app entry point. This is what you specify in the 'App URL' box in the Miro app settings
```
